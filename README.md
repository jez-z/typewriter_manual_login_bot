A typing bot for https://at4.schreibtrainer.com/

This bot uses selenium.
To start a bot download a typebot.exe file and run it. Then enter a words per minute number and wait until a browser window opens, log in to your account and start a new lecture.
After lecture done the bot will be automatically closed.

Partly inspired by https://github.com/patrickcerny/typewriterBot
